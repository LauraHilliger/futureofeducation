1
00:00:00,01 --> -0:00:03,26
I think that education has to be changed.

2
00:00:03,26 --> -00:00:12,30
And, in fact, there is something that can—and even must—revolutionize education.

3
-00:00:12,31 --> -00:00:15,94
The very shape that a new education will take, I have no idea.

4
-00:00:15,95 --> -00:00:19,30
But I think there is a revolution already on its way,

5
-00:00:19,31 --> -00:00:22,74
and it's dominating now, through the nature and diffusion of information

6
-00:00:22,75 --> -00:00:24,43
now possible thanks to the Internet.

7
-00:00:24,44 --> -00:00:29,25
Then, what we have right now, is a very powerful tool, the Internet,

8
-00:00:29,26 --> -00:00:34,70
and it makes possible for us, as teachers, who are not professionals of technology,

9
-00:00:34,71 --> -00:00:39,45
to have easy access to a tool for making projects,

10
-00:00:39,46 --> -00:00:44,49
and that result is that it will be more easy to visualize and share. 

11
-00:00:44,50 --> -00:00:46,33
The word "sharing" on the Internet is incredible.

12
-00:00:46,34 --> -00:00:51,30
Universities today are unable to keep up with the rapid developments or
adjust their curricula fast enough.

13
-00:00:51,31 --> -00:00:58,30
It will be very important in the future that we dont strictly depend on such universities

14
-00:00:58,31 --> -00:01:07,45
but rather we need to create informal educational environments, establish peer-to-peer learning,
and also accept alternative academic certifications.

15
-00:01:07,46 --> -00:01:12,35
Schools were teaching things that were obsolete ten years ago.

16
-00:01:12,36 --> -00:01:15,98
Because far as I'm concerned, the future is people teaching other people

17
-00:01:15,99 --> -00:01:17,98
using open web tools for helping each other,

18
-00:01:17,99 --> -00:01:20,35
and teaching each other open technologies,

19
-00:01:20,36 --> -00:01:29,67
and therefore inventing new things and new jobs.

20
-00:01:29,68 --> -00:01:33,00
I think the only way learning works is through a joyful insurgency.

21
-00:01:33,01 --> -00:01:39,00
By that I mean, it's not just rebelling against systems that exist,

22
-00:01:39,01 --> -00:01:44,00
but modeling the kind of excitement that comes from the spirit of trying something new

23
-00:01:44,01 --> -00:01:47,50
and really looking for a different kind of learning altogether.
